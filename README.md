React Native APOD 
------

### What is this?
This is a simple project using NASA APOD (Astronomic Picture of the Day) to display a list of pictures and also 
allow the user to favorite them. 

I've left my API key inside the file api.js (/src/config/api.js), so you can feel free
to use mine or just replace yours there.

Just a simple disclaimer that I am not that experienced with React Native and Javascript, since most of my
work is related to Android, but in case you find any way to improve the project (and I am pretty sure you will :D),
feel free to open a new issue and I will check it out for sure.

**Redux** (state management)<br/>
**React Native Router** (navigation)<br/>
**AsyncStorage** (local storage)<br/>
**Axios** (API requests)<br/>
